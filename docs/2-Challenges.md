## Terraform

Writing a whole set of TF provisioning scripts for AWS (I am used to GCP) required a lot of research and some trial and error, document lookup. Re-writing etc..

Testing the whole thing was the usual terrform apply excercise :).

Certificate creation and validation also took a bit as it didnt play nicely at first.
I had to delete / recreate a couple times.
